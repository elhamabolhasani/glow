![CIFAR-10 Samples](/samples/epoch_80.png?raw=true "CIFAR-10 Samples")

Implementation of Glow in PyTorch. Based on the paper:

  > [Glow: Generative Flow with Invertible 1x1 Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03039)\
  > Diederik P. Kingma, Prafulla Dhariwal\
  > _arXiv:1807.03039_

Training script and hyperparameters designed to match the
CIFAR-10 experiments described in Table 4 of the paper.
